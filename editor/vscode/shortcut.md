- On Windows, code formatting is available in VSCode through the shortcut `Shift` + `Alt` + `F`.
- On Mac, it is available through the shortcut `Shift` + `Option` + `F`.

Alternatively, you can find the shortcut, as well as other shortcuts, through the search functionality provided in the editor with `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (or `Command` + `Shift` + `P` on Mac), and then searching for __format code__.
